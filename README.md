In this exercise, I use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify different datasets and build a spam classifier. 

The first part consists of using an SVM without a Gaussian Kernel, I experiment with the regularization parameter.

In the second part, I use an SVM with a Gaussian kernel to fit a complex non-linear dataset.

Then, I use cross validation to find the optimal value of *C* and *sigma* to use an SVM on another dataset.

Finally,a spam classifier is built using the provided training and testing datasets.
